Excel: A spreadsheet application that allows users to perform calculations, organize data, create charts, and perform various data analysis tasks. Excel is used to clean, transform, and explore the data using formulas, functions, pivot tables, charts, and other features.
Power BI: A business intelligence tool that allows users to connect to various data sources, create interactive dashboards and reports, and share insights with others. Power BI is used to visualize the data and create dynamic dashboards that can answer various business questions and provide actionable insights.
Tableau: A data visualization tool that allows users to create stunning visualizations using drag-and-drop techniques. Tableau is used to explore the data and create compelling charts and graphs that can reveal patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
