- The bar graph on the top left corner shows the overall analytics of the company. It has four bars that represent four metrics: total employees, attrition rate, average salary, and average age. The graph shows that the company has 1470 employees, with an attrition rate of 16%, an average salary of $65,000, and an average age of 37 years. These numbers give a general overview of the company's workforce and its characteristics.<br>

- The pie chart in the top right corner shows the attrition rate of the company, which is the percentage of employees who leave the company voluntarily or involuntarily. The pie chart has two slices: one for employees who stayed and one for employees who left. The chart shows that out of 1470 employees, 237 left the company, which means the attrition rate is 16%. This number indicates how well the company is able to retain its employees and how satisfied they are with their jobs.<br>

- The line graph in the bottom left corner shows the attrition per department of the company. It has six lines that represent six departments: sales, research and development, human resources, technical support, marketing, and finance. The graph shows how many employees left each department over a period of 12 months. The graph shows that the sales department had the highest attrition rate, with 57 employees leaving in 12 months, followed by research and development with 47 employees leaving. The human resources department had the lowest attrition rate, with only 12 employees leaving in 12 months. This graph shows which departments are more prone to employee turnover and which ones are more stable.<br>

- The bar graph on the bottom right corner shows the attrition rate per gender and age band of the company. It has four bars that represent four groups: male under 30, male over 30, female under 30, and female over 30. The graph shows how many employees from each group left the company in percentage terms. The graph shows that the male under 30 group had the highest attrition rate, with 28% of them leaving the company, followed by female under 30 with 24%. The female over 30 group had the lowest attrition rate, with only 9% of them leaving the company. This graph shows how gender and age affect employee retention and satisfaction.<br>

- The table in the center of the dashboard shows the attrition rate per employee band of the company. It has five columns that represent five employee bands: entry-level, junior-level, mid-level, senior-level, and executive-level. The table shows how many employees from each band left the company in percentage terms. The table shows that the entry-level band had the highest attrition rate, with 22% of them leaving the company, followed by the junior level with 18%. The executive level band had the lowest attrition rate, with only 5% of them leaving the company. This table shows how employee position and career stage affect employee retention and satisfaction.
