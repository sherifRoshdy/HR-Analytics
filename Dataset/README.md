- The bar chart in the bottom right corner shows the age group distribution. It has four bars: one for under 30, one for 30-40, one for 40-50, and one for over 50. The bars show how many employees are in each age group in the company. The chart also shows the percentage of each age group in the total employee count.

This chart shows the age group distribution of the company's workforce. <br>

- The section that shows the attrition rate, job satisfaction rating, and average age has three fields: one for attrition rate, one for job satisfaction rating, and one for average age. The fields show how these metrics are calculated for the company as a whole. The attrition rate is calculated by dividing the number of employees who left the company by the total number of employees. The job satisfaction rating is calculated by taking the average of all employee ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The average age is calculated by taking the average of all employee ages. The section shows that the attrition rate is 15%, which means that out of every 100 employees, 15 left the company voluntarily or involuntarily. The job satisfaction rating is 3.7 out of 5, which means that on average, employees are moderately satisfied with their jobs. The average age is 37 years old, which means that on average, employees are middle-aged. <br>
- The legend explains the different colors used in the charts. It has four colors: blue, orange, green, and purple. The colors represent different categories or values depending on the type of chart. For example, in the pie chart that shows education distribution blue represents high school education level orange represents college education level green represents bachelor's degree education level purple represents master's degree or higher education level.
